# MagnetsGymEnv

This gym environment is used to train an algorithm in simulation before using
in a similar real world environment at the AI Institute in Dynamic Systems

## Description

This is simulation with a gym environment where an algorithm can switch ON or
OFF 4 electromagnets that are under a container.
A ferromagnetic ball is inside the container and can move inside of it with the
activities of the magnets

The goal of the agent is to move the ball to a target position by switching the
